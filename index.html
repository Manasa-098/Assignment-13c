        <p>2019 has undoubtedly been the year of Rohit Sharma. Be it Test, one-day or T20, Ro”Hit” has bossed the
            bowlers in all formats, and with each passing month, the legend of Rohit Sharma has only attracted more
            praise.</p>
        <h4>In case you haven’t been in on his meteoric journey this year, here is a quick recap: </h4>
        <li>
            Jan 2019: Rohit Sharma scores a vital 63* in the third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), helping
            India register the first-ever Test series win in Australia.

        </li>
        <li>Feb 2019: Rohit Sharma becomes the 14th Indian to play 200th ODI and leads India in the series win against
            New Zealand after ten long years.

        <li>March 2019: Rohit Sharma becomes the third-fastest cricketer to score 8000 ODI runs behind AB DE Villers and
            Virat Kohli. Not to forget, Rohit played his first 70 odd ODIs as a middle-order batsman.
        </li>
        <li>May 2019: Rohit Sharma leads Mumbai Indian to its fourth IPL tournament win against Chennai SuperKing (CSK)

        </li>
        <li>June 2019: Rohit Sharma (140) architects India’s win against arch-rival Pakistan and goes past Virat Kohli’s
            107 as the highest individual score against Pakistan in the World Cup. </li>
        <li>July 2019: Rohit Sharma becomes the only batsman to hit five centuries in single World Cup and the leading

        <p>Such a phenomenal landmark, and it doesn’t look like Rohit Sharma is stopping anytime soon. But as Alex
            Altman, author of Time Money, rightly said: “Success is like an iceberg, what people see is only on the
            surface.”<br>
            If you have a lump of coal and you apply immense pressure, and it will do one of two things: it crumbles
            into dust, or it will turn into a diamond. India, especially MS Dhoni, understood the value of Rohit Sharma
            and wanted him to play XI at any cost, and current team management’s decisions are an example of how Rohit
            turned into a priceless diamond they always knew he was. His journey has many lessons for talent managers
            and leaders to excel and succeed in today’s uncertain world.
